/**
 * WeatherReporter
 * Analyses weather data from files of weather-station measurements.
 *
 * The weather data files consist of a set of measurements from weather stations around
 * New Zealand at a series of date/time stamps.
 * For each date/time, the file has:
 *  A line with the date and time (four integers for day, month, year, and time)
 *   eg "24 01 2021 1900"  for 24 Jan 2021 at 19:00 
 *  A line with the number of weather-stations for that date/time 
 *  Followed by a line of data for each weather station:
 *   - name: one token, eg "Cape-Reinga"
 *   - (x, y) coordinates on the map: two numbers, eg   186 38
 *   - four numbers for temperature, dew-point, suface-pressure, and sea-level-pressure
 * Some of the data files (eg hot-weather.txt, and cold-weather.txt) have data for just one date/time.
 * The weather-all.txt has data for lots of times. The date/times are all in order.
 * You should look at the files before trying to complete the methods below.
 *
 * Note, the data files were extracted from MetOffice weather data from 24-26 January 2021

     *  CHALLENGE:
     *  Also finds the highest and lowest temperatures at that time, and
     *  plots them with a larger circle.
     *  (Hint: If more than one station has the highest (or coolest) temperature,
     *         you only need to draw a larger circle for one of them.
